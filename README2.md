# External APIs

## External API's Defined 
An external or open API is an API designed for access by a larger population as well as web developers. This implies that an external API can be easily used by developers inside the organization (that published the API) and any other developer from the outside who desires to register into the interface.

## Client-Side vs Server-Side Routing
This project is a terrific example of a Web API following the REST archetachture and is built to be dynamically deploed to any website and is a perfect example of server-side routing. Unlike client side where we ensure the user's experience is limited to say private or public routes __this__ project explores server-side routing where I have defined unique routes for API resources. i.e. (Specificity & Readability) specific endpoint to obtiain specific resources via CRUD methodology. 
Note... HTTP works as a request-response protocol between a client and server. Example: A client (browser) sends an HTTP request to the server; then the server returns a response to the client. The response contains status information about the request and may also contain the requested content. The two most common HTTP methods are: GET and POST.
